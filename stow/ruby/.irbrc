# Everything in here is run before each IRB session

# Example of how to load a gem:
# https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print
# begin
#   require 'awesome_print'
#   AwesomePrint.irb! # Makes AwesomePrint the default formatter for IRB
# rescue LoadError => err
#   warn "Couldn't load Awesome Print: #{err}"
# end
